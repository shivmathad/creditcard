this data is taken from the kaggle. data has undergone PCA so that coustmer information is not revealed. Class column tells us about the fraud committed or normal transaction has been made.
For Anamoly detection I have used three alogrithms from Sklearn package Isloation Forest, Localoutlierdetection and EllipticEnvelope
And compared the estimator based on their F-1 score respect to fraud committed.
